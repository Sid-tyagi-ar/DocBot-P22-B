Be a Responsible Owner
As
 the vehicle’s owner, you are respon-
sible for the safe and proper  operation
of your motorcycle.
Motorcycles are single-track vehicles.
Their  safe use and operation  are de-
pendent  upon  the use of proper  riding
techniques  as well as the expertise  of
the operator.  Every  operator  should
know  the following  requirements  be-
fore riding this motorcycle.
He or she should:
lObtain  thorough  instructions  from
a competent source on all aspects
of motorcycle operation.
lObserve the warnings and mainte-
nance  requirements  in this Own-
er’s Manual.
lObtain  qualified  training  in safe
and proper riding techniques.
lObtain  professional  technical
service  as indicated  in this Own-
er’s Manual  and/or  when  made
necessary  by mechanical  condi-
tions.lNever  o perate  a motorcycle  with-
out proper  training  or instruction.
Take  a training  course.  Beginners
should  receive  training  from a cer-
tified  instructor.  Contact  an au-
thorized  motorcycle  dealer  to find
out about  the training  courses
nearest you.
Safe Riding
Perform the pre-operation checks each
time you use the vehicle to make sure it
is in safe operating condition. Failure to
inspect or maintain the vehicle properly
increases  the possibility  of an accident
or equipment  damage.  See page
5-1 for a list of pre-operation
checks.
lThis motorcycle  is designed  to
carry  the operator  and a passen-
ger.
lThe failure  of motorists  to detect
and recognize  motorcycles  in traf-
fic is the predominating  cause  of
automobile/motorcycle accidents.
Many accidents have been caused
by an automobile  driver  who did
not see the motorcycle.  Making
yourself  conspicuous  appears  tobe very e ffective  in reducing  the
chance of this type of accident.
Therefore:
• Wear a brightly colored jacket.
• Use  extra  caution  when  you are
approaching  and passing
through  intersections,  since  in-
tersections  are the most  likely
places for motorcycle accidents
to occur.
• Ride  where  other  motorists  can
see you. Avoid  riding  in another
motorist’s blind spot.
• Never  maintain  a motorcycle
without  proper  knowledge.
Contact an authorized motorcy-
cle dealer to inform you on basic
motorcycle  maintenance.  Cer-
tain maintenance  can only be
carried out by certified staff.
lMany  accidents  involve  inexper-
ienced  operators.  In fact, many
operators who have been involved
in accidents  do not even have a
current motorcycle license.
• Make sure that you are qualified
and that you only lend your mo-
torcycle  to other  qualified  oper-
ators.
Safety information
1-11• Know  your s kills and limits.
Staying  within  your limits  may
help you to avoid an accident.
• We  recommend  that you prac-
tice riding  your motorcycle
where there is no traffic until you
have become  thoroughly  famili-
ar with the motorcycle and all of
its controls.
lMany accidents have been caused
by error of the motorcycle  opera-
tor. A typical error made by the op-
erator is veering wide on a turn due
to excessive  speed  or undercor-
nering  (insufficient  lean angle  for
the speed).
• Always obey the speed limit and
never travel faster than warrant-
ed by road and traffic  condi-
tions.
• Always  signal  before  turning  or
changing  lanes.  Make  sure that
other motorists can see you.
lThe posture  of the operator  and
passenger  is important  for proper
control.
• The  operator  should  keep  both
hands  on the handlebar  and
both feet on the operator  footr-ests during  o peration  to main-
tain control of the motorcycle.
• The  passenger  should  always
hold onto the operator,  the seat
strap  or grab bar, if equipped,
with both hands  and keep  both
feet on the passenger footrests.
Never  carry  a passenger  unless
he or she can firmly  place  both
feet on the passenger footrests.
lNever  ride under  the influence  of
alcohol or other drugs.
lThis motorcycle  is designed  for
on-road  use only. It is not suitable
for off-road use.
Protective Apparel
The majority  of fatalities  from motorcy-
cle accidents are the result of head inju-
ries. The use of a safety  helmet  is the
single most critical factor in the preven-
tion or reduction of head injuries.
lAlways wear an approved helmet.
lWear  a face shield  or goggles.
Wind  in your unprotected  eyes
could  contribute  to an impairment
of vision  that could  delay  seeing  a
hazard.lThe u se  of a jacket,  heavy  boots,
trousers,  gloves,  etc., is effective
in preventing  or reducing  abra-
sions or lacerations.
lNever  wear  loose-fitting  clothes,
otherwise  they could  catch  on the
control levers, footrests, or wheels
and cause injury or an accident.
lAlways  wear  protective  clothing
that covers  your legs, ankles,  and
feet. The engine or exhaust system
become  very hot during  or after
operation and can cause burns.
lA passenger  should  also observe
the above precautions.
Avoid Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
All engine  exhaust  contains  carbon
monoxide, a deadly gas. Breathing car-
bon monoxide  can cause  headaches,
dizziness,  drowsiness,  nausea,  confu-
sion, and eventually death.
Carbon  Monoxide  is a colorless,  odor-
less, tasteless  gas which  may be
present  even if you do not see or smell
any engine  exhaust.  Deadly  levels  of
carbon  monoxide  can collect  rapidly
and you can quickly  be overcome  and
unable  to save yourself.  Also,  deadly
Safety information
1-21levels  of c arbon  monoxide  can linger
for hours  or days in enclosed  or poorly
ventilated  areas.  If you experience  any
symptoms  of carbon  monoxide  poi-
soning, leave the area immediately, get
fresh  air, and SEEK  MEDICAL  TREAT-
MENT.
lDo not run engine  indoors.  Even  if
you try to ventilate  engine  exhaust
with fans or open  windows  and
doors,  carbon  monoxide  can rap-
idly reach dangerous levels.
lDo not run engine  in poorly  venti-
lated  or partially  enclosed  areas
such  as barns,  garages,  or car-
ports.
lDo not run engine  outdoors  where
engine  exhaust  can be drawn  into
a building  through  openings  such
as windows and doors.
Loading
Adding  accessories  or cargo  to your
motorcycle can adversely affect stabili-
ty and handling  if the weight  distribu-
tion of the motorcycle  is changed.  To
avoid the possibility of an accident, use
extreme  caution  when  adding  cargo  or
accessories  to your motorcycle.  Useextra  care w hen riding  a motorcycle
that has added  cargo  or accessories.
Here,  along  with the information  about
accessories  below,  are some  general
guidelines  to follow  if loading  cargo  to
your motorcycle:
The total weight  of the operator,  pas-
senger,  accessories  and cargo  must
not exceed  the maximum  load limit.
Operation  of an overloaded  vehicle
could cause an accident.
Maximum load:
171 kg (377 lb)
When  loading  w ithin this weight  limit,
keep the following in mind:
lCargo  and accessory  weight
should be kept as low and close to
the motorcycle  as possible.  Se-
curely pack your heaviest items as
close to the center of the vehicle as
possible  and make  sure to distrib-
ute the weight  as evenly  as possi-
ble on both  sides  of the
motorcycle  to minimize  imbalance
or instability.
lShifting  weights  can create  a sud-
den imbalance. Make sure that ac-cessories  an d cargo  are securely
attached  to the motorcycle  before
riding.  Check  accessory  mounts
and cargo restraints frequently.
• Properly  adjust  the suspension
for your load (suspension-ad-
justable  models  only),  and
check  the condition  and pres-
sure of your tires.
• Never  attach  any large  or heavy
items  to the handlebar,  front
fork, or front fender.  These
items,  including  such  cargo  as
sleeping  bags,  duffel  bags,  or
tents,  can create  unstable  han-
dling  or a slow steering  re-
sponse.
lThis vehicle  is not designed  to
pull a trailer  or to be attached  to
a sidecar.
Genuine Yamaha Accessories
Choosing  accessories  for your vehicle
is an important  decision.  Genuine
Yamaha  accessories,  which  are availa-
ble only from a Yamaha  dealer,  have
been  designed,  tested,  and approved
by Yamaha for use on your vehicle.
Safety information
1-31Many companies with no connection to
Ya
maha manufacture parts and acces-
sories  or offer other  modifications  for
Yamaha  vehicles.  Yamaha  is not in a
position  to test the products  that these
aftermarket  companies  produce.
Therefore,  Yamaha  can neither  en-
dorse  nor recommend  the use of ac-
cessories  not sold by Yamaha  or
modifications  not specifically  recom-
mended  by Yamaha,  even if sold and
installed by a Yamaha dealer.
Aftermarket Parts, Accessories,
and Modifications
While  you may find aftermarket  prod-
ucts similar  in design  and quality  to
genuine  Yamaha  accessories,  recog-
nize that some aftermarket accessories
or modifications  are not suitable  be-
cause  of potential  safety  hazards  to
you or others.  Installing  aftermarket
products  or having  other  modifications
performed  to your vehicle  that change
any of the vehicle’s design or operation
characteristics  can put you and others
at greater risk of serious injury or death.
You are responsible  for injuries  related
to changes in the vehicle.Keep  the f ollowing  guidelines  in mind,
as well as those  provided  under  “Loa-
ding” when mounting accessories.
lNever  install  accessories  or carry
cargo  that would  impair  the per-
formance  of your motorcycle.
Carefully  inspect  the accessory
before  using  it to make  sure that it
does  not in any way reduce
ground  clearance  or cornering
clearance,  limit suspension  travel,
steering  travel  or control  opera-
tion, or obscure lights or reflectors.
• Accessories  fitted  to the han-
dlebar  or the front fork area can
create instability due to improp-
er weight distribution or aerody-
namic  changes.  If accessories
are added  to the handlebar  or
front fork area,  they must  be as
lightweight  as possible  and
should be kept to a minimum.
• Bulky  or large  accessories  may
seriously  affect  the stability  of
the motorcycle  due to aerody-
namic  effects.  Wind  may at-
tempt  to lift the motorcycle,  or
the motorcycle  may become
unstable  in cross  winds.  Theseaccessories  ma y also cause  in-
stability  when  passing  or being
passed by large vehicles.
• Certain  accessories  can dis-
place  the operator  from his or
her normal  riding  position.  This
improper  position  limits  the
freedom  of movement  of the
operator  and may limit control
ability, therefore, such accesso-
ries are not recommended.
lUse caution  when  adding  electri-
cal accessories. If electrical acces-
sories  exceed  the capacity  of the
motorcycle’s  electrical  system,  an
electric  failure  could  result,  which
could  cause  a dangerous  loss of
lights or engine power.
Aftermarket Tires and Rims
The tires and rims that came  with your
motorcycle  were  designed  to match
the performance  capabilities  and to
provide  the best combination  of han-
dling, braking, and comfort. Other tires,
rims,  sizes,  and combinations  may not
be appropriate.  See page  7-15 for
tire specifications  and for information
on servicing and replacing your tires.
Safety information
1-41Transporting the Motorcycle
Be s
ure to observe  following  instruc-
tions  before  transporting  the motorcy-
cle in another vehicle.
lRemove  all loose  items  from the
motorcycle.
lCheck  that the fuel cock  (if equip-
ped) is in the off position  and that
there are no fuel leaks.
lShift the transmission into gear (for
models  with a manual  transmis-
sion).
lSecure  the motorcycle with  tie-
downs  or suitable  straps  that are
attached  to solid parts  of the mo-
torcycle,  such as the frame  or up-
per front fork triple clamp (and not,
for example,  to rubber-mounted
handlebars or turn signals, or parts
that could  break).  Choose  the lo-
cation  for the straps  carefully  so
the straps  will not rub against
painted surfaces during transport.
lThe suspension  should  be com-
pressed  somewhat  by the tie-
downs,  if possible,  so that the
motorcycle will not bounce exces-
sively during transport.

YR
C (Yamaha Ride Control)
Yamaha  Ride Control  is a system  that
incorporates  numerous  sensors  and
controls  to support  an improved  riding
experience.  The vehicle  senses  and
can react  to forces  along  the longitudi-
nal (front-to-back), lateral (left-to-right),
and vertical  (up-and-down)  axes.  Lean
angle  and  G-force  accelerations  are
also detected. This information is proc-
essed  multiple  times  a second  and the
related  physical  systems  are automati-
cally adjusted  as necessary.  The fol-
lowing  functions  represent  individual
YRC items  which  can be turned  on/off
or adjusted  to suit various  riders  and
riding  conditions.  For setting  details,
see pages 4-15 and 4-19.
EWA18221
WARNING
The Yamaha Ride Control (YRC) sys-
te
m is not a substitute  for the use of
proper  riding  techniques  or the ex-
pertise  of the operator.  This system
cannot  prevent  loss of control
caused  by rider  errors  such  as trav-
eling  faster  than warranted  by road
and traffic  conditions,  including  lossof traction  d ue to excessive  speed
when  entering  turns,  when  acceler-
ating  hard  at a sharp  lean angle,  or
while  braking,  and it cannot  prevent
front  wheel  slip or front  wheel  lift. As
with any motorcycle,  always  ride
within in your limits, be aware of sur-
rounding conditions, and ride appro-
priately  for those  conditions.
Become  thoroughly  familiar  with the
way the motorcycle  handles  with
various  YRC  settings  before  at-
tempting  more  advanced  maneu-
vers.

WARNING
The traction  c ontrol  system  is not a
substitute for riding appropriately for
the conditions. Traction control can-
not prevent  loss of traction  due to
excessive  speed  when  entering
turns,  when  accelerating  hard  at a
sharp  lean angle,  or while  braking,
and cannot  prevent  front  wheel  slip-
ping.  As with any vehicle,  approach
surfaces  that may be slippery  with
caution and avoid especially slippery
surfaces.
When  the k ey is turned  to “ON”,  the
traction  control  system  automatically
turns  on. The traction  control  system
can be turned  on or off manually  only
when  the key is in the “ON”  position
and the motorcycle is stopped.
TIP
Turn the t raction  control  system  off to
help free the rear wheel  if the motorcy-
cle gets stuck  in mud,  sand,  or other
soft surfaces.ECA16801
NOTICE
Use only t he specified  tires.  (See
page  7-15.)  Using  different  sized
tires will prevent  the traction  control
system  from  controlling  tire rotation
accurately.
SCS
Th
e slide control  system  regulates  en-
gine power  output  when  a sideward
slide is detected in the rear wheel. It ad-
justs power  output  based  on data from
the IMU. This system supports the trac-
tion control  system  to contribute  to a
smoother ride.
EBM
The engine brake management system
reduces engine torque when decelerat-
ing. The fuel injection,  ignition  timing,
and electronic  throttle  valve  are elec-
tronically  adjusted  by the ECU.  There
are 2 settings  to suit the track,  riding
conditions,  or your personal  prefer-
ence.Special features

WARNING
Make  sure t he engine  has sufficient-
ly slowed  before  shifting  to a lower
gear.  Engaging  a lower  gear  when
the engine  speed  is too high could
make  the rear wheel  lose traction.
This could  cause  loss of control,  an
accident  and injury.  It could  also
cause engine or drivetrain damage.
Quick shifter
Th
e quick  shifter  allows  for clutch  lev-
er-less,  electronically-assisted  shifting.When  the s ensor  on the shift rod de-
tects the appropriate motion in the shift
pedal,  engine  power  output  is momen-
tarily adjusted  to allow  for the gear
change to occur.
The quick  shifter  does  not operate
when  the clutch  lever is pulled,  there-
fore normal  shifting  can be done  even
when  the quick  shifter  is set to on.
Check  the quick  shifter  indicator  for

LIF
Th
e lift control  system  reduces  the rate
at which the front wheel will continue to
rise during  extreme  acceleration,  such
as during  starts  or out-of-corner  exits.
When  front-wheel  lift is detected,  en-
gine power  is regulated  to slow front-
wheel  lift while  still providing  good
acceleration.
BC
The brake control system regulates hy-
draulic  brake  pressure  for the front and
rear wheels  when  the brakes  are ap-
plied  and wheel  lock is detected.  This
system has two settings.Special features
3-33BC1 is s tandard  ABS,  which  adjusts
brake pressure based on vehicle speed
and wheel  speed  data.  BC1 is de-
signed  to engage  and maximize  brak-
ing when the vehicle is upright.
BC2 uses additional  data from the IMU
to regulate  applied  brake  power  when
cornering  to suppress  lateral  wheel
slip.

levels  available.  Setting  level 1 applies
the least system intervention, while set-
ting level 5 applies  the most  overall
traction control.

ake control system (BC)
The brake control system regulates hy-
draulic  brake  pressure  for the front and
rear wheels  independently  when  the
brakes  are applied  and wheel  lock is
detected. This system has two settings
which  can be changed  in the settings
MENU. (See page 4-19.)
BC1 is standard  ABS,  which  adjusts
brake pressure based on vehicle speed
and wheel  speed  data.  BC1 is de-
signed  to engage  and maximize  brak-
ing when  the vehicle  is upright.  BC2
uses additional  data from the IMU to
regulate  applied  brake  power  when
cornering  to suppress  lateral  wheel
slip.
Regarding  ABS,  operate  the brakes  as
you would  conventional  brakes.  When
the brake  control  system  engages,  a
pulsating  sensation  may be felt at the
brake  lever or brake  pedal  as the hy-
draulic unit rapidly applies and reduces
brake pressure. In this situation, contin-
ue to apply  the brake  lever and brake
pedal to allow the ABS to work—do not
“pump  the brakes”  as this will reduce
braking effectiveness.EWA16051
WARNING
Always  keep a s ufficient  distance
from  the vehicle  ahead  to match  the
riding speed even with ABS.
lThe ABS performs  best with
long braking distances.
lOn certain  surfaces,  such  as
rough  or gravel  roads,  the brak-
ing distance  may be longer  with
the ABS than without.
The ABS h ydraulic  unit is monitored  by
the ABS ECU, which will revert the sys-
tem to conventional  braking  if a mal-
function occurs.
EWA20891
WARNING
The brake c ontrol  system  is not a
substitute  for the use of proper  rid-
ing and braking  techniques.  The
brake control system cannot prevent
all loss of traction  due to over-brak-
ing from  excessive  speed,  or lateral
wheel  slip when  braking  on slippery
surfaces.
TIPThe ABS p erforms  a self-diagnostic
test when  the vehicle  is started  and
reaches  a speed  of 5 km/h  (3 mi/h).
During this test, a clicking noise may be
audible  from the hydraulic  control  unit,
and a vibration  may be felt at the brake
lever or pedal, but this is normal.

Ch
ecking the spark plugs
The spark  plugs  are important  engine
components, which should be checked
periodically,  preferably  by a Yamaha
dealer.  Since  heat and deposits  will
cause  any spark  plug to slowly  erode,
they should  be removed  and checked
in accordance  with the periodic  main-
tenance  and lubrication  chart.  In addi-
tion, the condition  of the spark  plugs
can reveal the condition of the engine.
The porcelain insulator around the cen-
ter electrode of each spark plug should
be a medium-to-light  tan (the ideal col-
or when  the vehicle  is ridden  normally),
and all spark  plugs  installed  in the en-
gine should  have the same  color.  If any
spark  plug shows  a distinctly  different
color,  the engine  could  be operating
improperly. Do not attempt to diagnose
such problems  yourself.  Instead,  have
a Yamaha dealer check the vehicle.
If a spark plug shows signs of electrode
erosion  and excessive  carbon  or other
deposits, it should be replaced.Specified spark plug:
NI
TERRA CO., LTD.(Former NGK
SPARK PLUG CO., LTD.)/LMAR9E-J
Before installing a spark plug, the spark

ug gap should  be measured  with a
wire thickness gauge and, if necessary,
adjusted to specification.

YAMALUBE  oil is a Genuine  YAMAHA
Part born of the engineers’ passion and
belief that engine oil is an important liq-
uid engine component. We form teams
of specialists in the fields of mechanical
engineering, chemistry, electronics and
track  testing,  and have them  develop
the engine  together  with the oil it will
use. Yamalube  oils take full advantage
of the base  oil’s qualities  and blend  in
the ideal balance  of additives  to make
sure the final oil clears our performance
standards.  Thus,  Yamalube  mineral,
semisynthetic  and synthetic  oils have
their own distinct characters and value.
Yamaha’s  experience  gained  over
many  years  of research  and develop-

from the factory,  trouble  may occur
during  operation.  Any problem  in the
fuel, compression,  or ignition  systems,
for example,  can cause  poor starting
and loss of power.
The following  troubleshooting charts
represent  quick  and easy procedures
for checking  these  vital systems  your-
