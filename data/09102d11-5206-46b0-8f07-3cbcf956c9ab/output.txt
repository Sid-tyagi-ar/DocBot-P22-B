Grading System (Grade Points) for B.Tech Programme at 11T Mandi:
At the end of the semester, a student is awarded a letter grade in each of his/her courses by the concerned Instructor-in-
charge taking into account his/her performance in various examinations, quizzes, assignments, laboratory work (if any)
etc., besides regularity of attendance in classes.

Grade Points 10 9 8 7 6 4 0
O = Outstanding, A = Very Good, B = Good, C = Average, D = Below Average, E = Pass, F = Fail.
PassfFail Course: Letter Grade 'P' = Pass, 'F' = Fail. This grade is not counted towards SGPA/CGPA calculation.
Note:
The credits for the course depend on the academic load, which, in turn, is determined by the number of contact
hours (lectures and tutorials), laboratory hours (if applicable) & additional hours that a student is expected to
devote per week.
For theory classes and tutorials: I credit is awarded for I lecture hour/week (14 lecture hours per semester).
For Lab Courses, Practicals & Practicums: The following system is followed.
Hours per week 1-2 3-4 5-6 7-8

Semester/Cumulative Grade Point Average (SGPA/CGPA):
SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) / CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is a weighted average of the grade
points earned by a student in the credited courses (on a 10-Point Scale) and is computed by using the following formula:
SGPA or CGPA = Ci. Ci
where n is the number of courses credited in semester (in SGPA) or the number of courses credited from the first semester
to the latest semester (in CGPA). Ci & Gi denote the credits associated and grade-points obtained respectively in a course i.
For SGPA, represents the number of credits registered in that semester. For CGPA, represents the total eamed
credits i.e. number of credits earned by passing the courses.
Minimum graduating CGPA for B.Tech Programme: 5.0
No Class or Division is awarded for B.Tech Programme.
The medium of instruction and assessment in this Institute is English.
The individual course evaluation grades assigned by this Institute conform to a 10 point scale. CGPA is a
weighted average of the grade points earned by the student based on a cumulative evaluation of performance in all
the relevant/credited courses. The CGPA is based on a 10 point scale with ten being the maximum and zero being
the minimum. It is certified that the Grade points awarded by 11T Mandi are not convertible into percentage.
However, notionally, the CGPA may be multiplied by a factor of 10 to obtain a numerical percentage i.e Marks in
percentage = 10 X CGPA (notional). The provision is applicable to all graduates of the Institute irrespecuve of the
year of the graduation.

Respected
Ma’am/Sir,
I
am
writing
to
express
my
fervent
interest
in
participating
in
the
semester 
exchange
program
at
Technische
Universität
München
(TUM)
for
the 
upcoming
semester
i.e.
semester
5
in
the
CIT
(Informatics)
department
at 
TUM.
I
believe
this
opportunity
aligns
perfectly
with
my
academic
goals
and 
personal
aspirations.
I
have
been
keenly
interested
in
computer
science
and
robotics
along
with 
emerging
fields
such
as
quantum
computing.
TUM's
reputation
for 
excellence
in
these
areas
combined
with
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
the 
likes
of
renowned
professors
such
as
Prof
Daniel
Cremers,
Prof
Alin 
Albu-schäffer
and
Prof
Knoll,
makes
TUM
the
best
environment
to
broaden 
my
knowledge
and
understanding
of
this
field.
Additionally,
this
exchange 
program
goes
beyond
academics
for
me
as
I
am
eager
to
immerse
myself 
in
the
vibrant
German
culture
too.
I'm
excited
to
explore
the
beautiful
art 
and
nightlife
scenery,
the
historic
Berlin
Wall,
Brandenburg
Gate,
along
with 
a
multitude
of
places
that
house
2
millennia
of
history.
As
a
highly
motivated
and
adaptable
student
with
a
strong
consistent 
academic
record
(current
GPA
of
9.19/10),
I
am
confident
that
I
will
excel
in 
this
program.
My
experience
in
projects
such
as
the
“Mars
Rover
Project” 
(URC)
and
“Inter
IIT
Mid
-
Quantum
Computing
Challenge”
(Mphasis),
has 
honed
my
teamwork,
communication,
technical
and
research
skills.
I
am
a 
dedicated
individual
with
a
strong
work
ethic,
and
I
am
confident
that
I
will 
be
a
valuable
asset
to
the
exchange
program.
I
am
committed
to
actively
engaging
with
the
academic
and
social
life
at 
TUM.
I
believe
this
exchange
program
will
not
only
enrich
my
academic 
pursuits
but
also
foster
personal
growth
and
international
understanding. 
The
knowledge
and
experience
gained
will
enable
me
to
contribute 
significantly
to
my
home
university
upon
return,
inspiring
others
to
pursue 
similar
opportunities.
Furthermore,
this
experience
will
be
instrumental
in 
shaping
my
future
career
path
in
robotics.
Thank
you
for
considering
my
application.
Sincerely,
Sukhvansh

•Overview The project aims at addressing the challenge of passenger re-accommodation due to planned
schedule changes in airlines.
•The key objectives include identifying impacted flights and passengers, determining suitable alternate
flights, ranking alternate flight solutions, and prioritizing PNR re-accommodation.
•The solution incorporates a business rule engine for flexibility in rule application and produces two sets of
solution files: a default flight level re-accommodation solution and an exception list for individual PNR
re-accommodation.•The project emphasizes the creation of various rule profiles, flexibility in rule enforcement, and the
generation of comprehensive solution files catering to different scenarios.
