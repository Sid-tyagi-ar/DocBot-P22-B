0,"b' \n\nA spring is a device that stores and releases energy in a controlled manner. It is typically made of a metal wire or a rubber band and is used to provide a restoring force or to absorb energy. The length of a spring is determined by its elasticity and the amount of force applied to it.\n\nWhen a force is applied to a spring, it stretches or compresses the spring. The amount of stretch or compression is determined by the stiffness of the spring. The stiffness of a spring is determined by its elasticity.\n\nA spring can be used to store energy, or it can be used to absorb energy. When a spring is used to store energy, it is stretched or compressed when a force is applied to it. When a spring is used to absorb energy, it is compressed when a force is applied to it.\n\nA spring is a common device in many applications, such as in cars, bikes, and musical instruments.<eos>'",images\extracted_image_file_1_unlocked_1915.jpg
