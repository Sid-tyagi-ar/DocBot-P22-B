0,"b' \n\nA gear is a device that changes the speed of a rotating object. It is typically used in a transmission to allow the engine to rotate at different speeds. A gear has a set of teeth that mesh with a set of teeth on a different gear. When the two gears are rotated in the same direction, they mesh together and rotate at the same speed. When the two gears are rotated in opposite directions, they mesh together and rotate at different speeds.<eos>'",images\extracted_image_file_1_unlocked_1935.jpg
